        <p>Pasta! An Italian dish so good but yet so easy!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients and Equipment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound uncooked pasta</li>
            <li>A large (6- to 8-quart) pot</li>
            <li>Four to six quarts of cold water</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons of salt</li>
            <li>A long-handled heat-proof spoon</li>
            <li>A colander for draining the pasta</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring the water to a full, rolling boil. Before adding the pasta, add salt to the boiling water. If you don't season the cooking water, the pasta may taste flat — no matter how salty the sauce may be. The temperature of the water will drop once you add the pasta, so make sure the water's at a full boil before adding the pasta noodles.</li>
            <li>Stir gently. Short pasta should be stirred immediately after adding it to water, but let spaghetti and long strands soften for a minute before stirring. Leave the pot uncovered while the pasta cooks.</li>
            <li>Cook your pasta at a rapid boil until it's tender but slightly firm to the bite. The longer you cook pasta, the mushier it gets. Don't rely on the clock to evaluate doneness; bite a piece instead. If it's done, it will be firm but tender and cooked through. If you're using cooked pasta as an ingredient in a recipe — like baked ziti or lasagna — it can be even firmer, as the noodles will absorb liquid and cook more in the oven.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta in a colander. Do not rinse the pasta with water unless your recipe specifically says to. </li>
            <li>Serve and Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
